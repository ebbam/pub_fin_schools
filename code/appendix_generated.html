<h1>Descriptive Regressions</h1>
<p>First, we employ a two-way fixed effects ordinary least-squares panel model with standard errors clustered by commuting zone. We outline the model specification immediately below: <span id="eq-desc_function"><span class="math display">\[
Y_{it} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{x}X_{it} + \delta_1 Enrollment_{it} + \delta_2 IGR_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it}

We focus on elementary education for two reasons. First, this restriction partly shields against a justifiable concern about the endogeneity between wages and quality of local public education. Whereas funding for high school could likely affect local wages given such students are of working age, funding for elementary education is unlikely to impact wage rates via human capital investments. Second, in terms of public impact, elementary education is of foundational importance in the lives of children . Slips in public education provision at such a young age could have scarring effects for children in such school systems. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> represents either a CZ or state fixed effect and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_t\)</span> represents year-fixed effects, respectively. <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{it}\)</span> represents the error term. We control for enrollment to account for scaling factors in education expenditure and intergovernmental transfers to account for the significant role of such transfers in funding education expenditure. <span class="math inline">\(X_{it}\)</span> takes three forms represented by <a href="#eq-gdp-function" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;6</a>, <a href="#eq-wage-function" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;7</a>, <a href="#eq-hpi-function" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;8</a> where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>-year time lags. We estimate all equations in levels and growth rates. <span id="eq-gdp-function"><span class="math display">\[
X_{it}^{GDP} = \sum_{h=0}^{2} \beta_h^{\text{GDP}} \log(\text{GDP}_{i,t-h})

X_{it}^{HPI} = \sum_{h=0}^{4} \beta_h^{\text{HPI}} \log(\text{HPI}_{i,t-h})
\tag{4}\]</span></span> Table 2 reports the results from regressions of log elementary education expenditure per pupil on contemporaneous and lagged measures of local economic activity. Table 3 presents the analogous specifications using annualized growth rates to capture short-run dynamics.The estimates in Table 2 show that per-pupil education spending is systematically higher in commuting zones with ‘stronger’ local economies measured in local wages, industrial GDP, and asset prices. In the baseline specification (Column 1), the elasticity of education spending with respect to local GDP per capita (private industry) is positive and statistically significant once lagged values are included. A one-percent increase in local GDP per capita two years prior is associated with roughly a 0.15% increase in current education expenditure per pupil, suggesting that fiscal capacity effects unfold gradually over time. Intergovernmental revenue per pupil emerges as the strongest and most consistent predictor of education expenditure. A 1% increase in intergovernmental transfers is associated with approximately a 0.2–0.35% increase in per-pupil education spending, controlling for unit/state and year fixed effects. This finding highlights the importance of state and federal aid in sustaining local education budgets. Lagged economic indicators, particularly private industry GDP and average weekly wages, are also positively and significantly associated with education spending. In the case of industry GDP, the magnitude of the coefficients increases with the number of lags, suggesting a gradual adjustment process by which local economic growth translates into higher public investment in education over time. For example, a 1% increase in lagged (t–2) real private GDP per capita is associated with a 0.15% increase in per-pupil spending. The house price index also enters positively and significantly in contemporaneous and time-dynamic specifications (up to t–3) underscoring the fundamental relationship between community asset wealth and public education expenditure. The growth rate regressions, while explaining less variance overall, largely confirm the patterns observed in the level specifications. Intergovernmental revenue growth remains a strong and highly significant determinant of education expenditure growth, with coefficients &gt;0.3%. Lagged wage and GDP growth also emerge as important predictors, particularly at longer lags. Notably, wage growth two years prior is associated with a 0.31% increase in education spending growth, suggesting that labor market improvements take at least a year to materialize in local education budgets which hints at the relevance of our primary identifying relationship. Taken together, these results offer three key insights. First, public education investment is strongly mediated by external fiscal flows, reaffirming the role of intergovernmental transfers in equalizing local education finance. Second, local labor market conditions, captured through wages and GDP, exert lagged, cumulative effects on education spending consistent with lagged effects of local economic conditions to industrial change. Third, local housing markets play a significant role shaping education budgets, reflecting the link between property values and tax revenues. Additionally, in both levels and growth rates, the consistently negative coefficient on enrollment indicates a scaling relationship in which expenditure per pupil declines as enrollment sizes grow. We also estimate these regressions using state rather than commuting-zone level fixed effects to account for the relevance of state-level tax regimes and policies that govern education. Though the relationships remain somewhat stable across both level and growth rate specifications, the state-fixed effects affect the stability of our coefficient estimates. Explanation for excluded growth rates: the AR1 beta is nowhere near 1 and therefore growth rate does not work. the coefficient is a long way from one which means I do not have to worry about unit roots. </p>

<section id="wage-based-shift-share-instrument-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wage-based-shift-share-instrument-results">Wage-based Shift Share Instrument Results</h2>
<p>First, we display the results for a 2SLS estimation using our wage-based shift-share instrument.</p>
<p>In Table 5, the instrumental variable estimates provide evidence of a robust causal relationship between local wages and public education expenditure. Utilising our wage-based shift-share instrument we see highly significant and relevant first-stage relationships when the shift-share instrument is imposed in levels (except in column 5). In each case except columns 5-6 (l1 SS, CZ FE), the first-stage regression yields a statistically significant extcolor{violet}{and economically large coefficient} extcolor{red}{Checking the interpretation of this}. Varying the time-lag and inclusion of state or commuting zone fixed effects, we see that a 1% increase in the shift-share measure (which can be interpreted as a natural logarithm) is associated with a 0.02-0.06% increase in average weekly wages (p &lt; 0.01), with an F-statistic between 11-103 (near or above conventional weak instrument thresholds) confirming instrument relevance. The Wu-Hausman tests reject the null of exogeneity, confirming that OLS estimates are biased and IV estimation is appropriate. Wald tests of joint significance further support the strength of the instruments.</p>
<p>Using wage shocks in levels yields strong instruments, high first-stage F-statistics, and stable second-stage estimates: higher local wages robustly increase education spending. Furthermore, given the dependent variable measures per pupil expenditure, this result implies direct effects in experience per student. In contrast, when shocks are measured in growth rates (Table 6), the instruments lose predictive power (first-stage F-statistics ~1–2), resulting in weak identification. The second-stage coefficients become unstable and often insignificant, while Hausman tests fail to reject exogeneity. This suggests that the growth-rate specification is poorly identified and cannot provide reliable causal inference, whereas the level specification produces credible and consistent results.</p>
<p>The specification that uses wage shocks in levels provides the most credible identification strategy. Since levels capture the cross-sectional fiscal variation that drives differences in property values and school spending, the level specification is more consistent with the economic mechanisms of interest and delivers more reliable causal estimates. At the same time, the weakness of the growth-rate specification does raise concerns about the robustness of the results. If the relationship between wages, house prices, and education expenditure is driven by common non-stationary trends, then regressions in levels risk spurious correlation. The fact that the IV design loses power when variables are differenced into growth rates may suggest that part of the strong level results reflect long-run trends rather than short-run causal shocks. While the large first-stage F-statistics and Hausman tests in the level specification support its validity, the weak performance of the growth-rate version cautions that the results could be sensitive to issues of persistence and trending in the data. Taken together, these results suggest that while the level specification provides strong identification and compelling evidence of a positive causal effect of local wages on education spending, the weak performance of the growth-rate specification highlights the need for caution, as the strength of the findings may partly reflect long-run trending relationships rather than purely exogenous shocks. However, examining the structure of the growth rate shock, the instability of the variable is likely causing the poor identification in the growth rate regressions.</p>

<section id="high-income-outliers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="high-income-outliers">High-Income Outliers</h3>
<p>There is a somewhat non-linear relationship between property taxes and elementary expenditure as property taxes collected rise as represented in Figure 22 below. This happens largely as a result of very high-income commuting zones. Therefore, we exclude any commuting zone that spends more than 22k per pupil to avoid any distorting effects. This removes 12 CZs (~2% of the sample). To assess whether the main results are driven by a small number of very high-income jurisdictions, I re-estimate the baseline and IV specifications excluding such outliers. The findings are fully consistent with the baseline analysis: house prices remain a strong predictor of local education spending, and the IV estimates continue to imply that a 10% increase in house prices raises per-pupil expenditure by roughly 4–6%. The wage-based shift-share instrument yields somewhat larger point estimates, though with wider standard errors, while the GDP-based instrument produces effects in line with earlier results. Overall, this robustness exercise confirms that the causal relationship between housing wealth and education spending is not confined to affluent areas but reflects a broader, generalizable pattern. These findings confirm that the main result is not driven solely by affluent jurisdictions, but reflects a more general relationship between local housing wealth and education spending.</p>

<p>Furthermore, given the heterogeneity in reliance on intergovernmental transfers (largely coming from the state), we interact all economic predictors above with a variable that represents the share of total elementary education expenditure (as a continuous variable) coming from state-level funding.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wage-based-shift-share-instrument-results-1">Wage-based Shift Share Instrument Results</h2>
<p>First, we display the results for a 2SLS estimation using our wage-based shift-share instrument.</p>
<p>In Table 5, the instrumental variable estimates provide evidence of a robust causal relationship between local wages and public education expenditure. Utilising our wage-based shift-share instrument we see highly significant and relevant first-stage relationships when the shift-share instrument is imposed in levels (except in column 5). In each case except columns 5-6 (l1 SS, CZ FE), the first-stage regression yields a statistically significant extcolor{violet}{and economically large coefficient} extcolor{red}{Checking the interpretation of this}. Varying the time-lag and inclusion of state or commuting zone fixed effects, we see that a 1% increase in the shift-share measure (which can be interpreted as a natural logarithm) is associated with a 0.02-0.06% increase in average weekly wages (p &lt; 0.01), with an F-statistic between 11-103 (near or above conventional weak instrument thresholds) confirming instrument relevance. The Wu-Hausman tests reject the null of exogeneity, confirming that OLS estimates are biased and IV estimation is appropriate. Wald tests of joint significance further support the strength of the instruments.</p>
<p>Using wage shocks in levels yields strong instruments, high first-stage F-statistics, and stable second-stage estimates: higher local wages robustly increase education spending. Furthermore, given the dependent variable measures per pupil expenditure, this result implies direct effects in experience per student. In contrast, when shocks are measured in growth rates (Table 6), the instruments lose predictive power (first-stage F-statistics ~1–2), resulting in weak identification. The second-stage coefficients become unstable and often insignificant, while Hausman tests fail to reject exogeneity. This suggests that the growth-rate specification is poorly identified and cannot provide reliable causal inference, whereas the level specification produces credible and consistent results.</p>
<p>The specification that uses wage shocks in levels provides the most credible identification strategy. Since levels capture the cross-sectional fiscal variation that drives differences in property values and school spending, the level specification is more consistent with the economic mechanisms of interest and delivers more reliable causal estimates. At the same time, the weakness of the growth-rate specification does raise concerns about the robustness of the results. If the relationship between wages, house prices, and education expenditure is driven by common non-stationary trends, then regressions in levels risk spurious correlation. The fact that the IV design loses power when variables are differenced into growth rates may suggest that part of the strong level results reflect long-run trends rather than short-run causal shocks. While the large first-stage F-statistics and Hausman tests in the level specification support its validity, the weak performance of the growth-rate version cautions that the results could be sensitive to issues of persistence and trending in the data. Taken together, these results suggest that while the level specification provides strong identification and compelling evidence of a positive causal effect of local wages on education spending, the weak performance of the growth-rate specification highlights the need for caution, as the strength of the findings may partly reflect long-run trending relationships rather than purely exogenous shocks. However, examining the structure of the growth rate shock, the instability of the variable is likely causing the poor identification in the growth rate regressions.</p>

<p>When applying our instrumental variable design we find that majority of our relevant signal is picked up in regions across both trend metrics. Though the effects are more consistent across wage-trending sub-samples.</p>
