  Explores the effect of uneven industrial wage growth on public education expenditure through its effect on local property values in the US. The work aims to illuminate the elasticity of public education expenditure to changes in local livelihoods and economic conditions with implications for the delivery of public services in a political economy defined by greater income and wealth inequality.

# Procedural Notes {#sec-procedural-notes}

The following document summarises the progress made thus far on Chapter
1: Local Fiscal Risks of Decarbonisation of my DPhil. The work aims to
pursue a better understanding of how industrial transformation impacts
local well-being. From an original interest in looking at all aspects of
local public finance, the project has narrowed to focus on expenditure
on public education and its connection to industrial prosperity and
transformation.

Current strategy/research plan: 1. Outcome: Educational Expenditure 2.
Treatment (endogenous): Wages, Economic Growth, Property Values,
Property Taxes 3. Instrument: Industry Shares of Employment in high vs.
low wage growth industries/sectors - plausible exogeneity comes from
industrial shares. Need to justify the choice of base-year for the
shift-share instrument such that industries were "present" but still
nascent (this is important because there are likely to be certain
industries that "cropped up" post-baseline completely unrelated to the
industrial composition before right?)

Recall the work from the previous meeting:

1.  After reading more work on US economic geography, it became clear
    that aggregating counties up to commuting zones was the better
    choice for analysis at sub-state level as these areas more
    accurately represent local labour markets/economies/commuting zones
    \href{https://www.ddorn.net/data.htm\#Local\%20Labor\%20Market\%20Geography}{David Dorn's Resource Page}
    \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03829-5}{Fowler et al. 2024}.
2.  Below, I provide some baseline regressions to demonstrate the
    relationships between key variables in the dataset.
3.  Next, I turn to an instrumental variable application in which I use
    coal mine counts and production volumes as an instrument for
    property taxes. Coal mine counts do not serve as good instruments
    but coal production passes relevance and exogeneity restrictions. I
    believe a strong argument can be made for the exclusion restriction
    to be satisfied. I provide supporting statistical tests for all that
    demonstrate the unfitness of coal mine counts but fitness of coal
    production. Along this line, we can hopefully discuss other sources
    of variation in industrial/economic productivity that might lead to
    property value spirals (positive or negative) to test the property
    tax channel.
4.  I identify declining vs. growing regions by estimating
    commuting-zone growth rates conditional on state and national level
    growth rates. Using this distinction (on both a per capita and total
    gdp bases and a lenient vs. stringent magnitude threshold), I rerun
    the key regressions identified in steps 2 and 3 on the subgroups
    (declining and growing regions).

Note: Any warnings about "missing observations" or "NA being removed"
relates to the lags incorporated, except in the Bartik estimations.

# Introduction

**Although emissions-intensive energy demand is (somewhat) uniformly
distributed across the country, extraction of inputs to energy supply is
highly geographically concentrated** @tomer2021, @lim2023,
@hendrickson2018 .[^1]

[^1]: Currently, about 1.7 million people (1% of US employment) work in
    the fossil fuel sector. The fossil fuel sector is defined here as
    all oil, gas, and coal operations including extraction, support
    activities, and utilities @tomer2021. Although this number is small
    in relation to overall US employment, these workers are highly
    geographically concentrated with entire communities often dependent
    on these industries for their livelihoods @lim2023,
    @hendrickson2018, @tomer2021, @aklin2022. Additionally, the workers
    set to be displaced by a green transition are not located in the
    areas that will see the greatest job growth and have historically
    exhibited low geographic mobility @lim2023.

Concentrated industries often play a significant role in
community-building and, in certain instances, create entire communities
that were not there before @bell2010, @lochery2022, @rhodes2020,
@hendrickson2018, @walker2021 . If not handled with care, disentangling
fossil fuel production from communities dependent on the industry can,
and already has, resulted in some of the well-documented ills that often
accompany poorly managed deindustrialisation @rhodes2020. For example,
declines in manufacturing jobs (including coal extraction) in pockets of
the US have led to documented underemployment, a rise in deaths of
despair, and a rising discontent with existing political structures
@autor2013, @broz2021, @farrefasani2018, @metcalf2019, @young2023,
@rodrÃ­guez-pose2021, @mathews2010, @mclean2016, @carley2018 .

**Finally, the US labor market is historically, socially, and
politically embedded in the fossil fuel industry in a spatially
heterogeneous way** @lim2023 . [^2]

[^2]: Somewhat fortunately, the proportion of US workers embedded in the
    fossil fuel industry is relatively small, implying a lower than
    feared cost of ensuring a just transition for these workers. In
    2022, in terms of extraction, oil represents the largest source of
    employment with around 500,000 workers, natural gas with 200,000,
    and coal with 50,000 employees. This smaller number should not be
    interpreted as a reason not to invest in stabilising community and
    worker well-being given the consequences of poorly managed and
    localised industrial decline have been well documented in both US
    and global history.

**Furthermore, the dismantling of an embedded industry risks clashing
with community economic identities formed around it.** Evidence from
political economy, ethnographical, and economic history investigations
indicate the presence and strong persistence of community economic
identities, particularly as they interact with questions of class
@bell2012, @bell2010 . For example, long-term exposure to oil and gas
production in counties across the US have been found to influence
current climate change denial, even when such production ceased decades
earlier @dewitte .

**Stoking such community economic identities have been found to
contribute to polarization if they are under particular economic duress
or pressure.** For example, Stewart et al. find, through a two-group
agent-based model of social interactions under different economic
conditions, that under conditions of economic decline or increasing
inequality, some members of the population benefit from adopting a
risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy @stewart2020 .
\textcolor{red}{Look at sources cited in Stewart et al. good lit review on the effect of economic decline on polarisation.}

**Abolishing the fossil fuel industry would also eliminate one of the
most dangerous legal professions on offer in the United States.**
Decarbonisation, although it stands to set off the cascading local
effects of deindustrialisation, could importantly eliminate some of the
more dangerous and grueling professions legally available in the US.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
mining is consistently reported as one of the top ten most dangerous
occupations in the US from the perspective of workplace injury and
death. \[Could include statistic here about black lung disease as an
affliction only affecting miners - 16% of miners with 25 years of work
experience - incurable with life expectancy reduced by 8-12 years.\]

**In many parts of the United States, local well-being is heavily
cointegrated with industrial prosperity and stability, not least through
the channel of public expenditure.**

\begin{itemize} 
  \item Proof of cointegrating relationship 
  \item Economic diversity and public well-being 
\end{itemize}

A recent study by Resources for the Future found that US revenues from
fossil fuels generated about \$ 138 billion annually for US localities,
states, tribes, and the federal government @raimi2022 . This amount is
forecast to decline by 2050 even in a business-as-usual scenario
assuming no changes in climate policy stringency. The study also finds
that Wyoming, North Dakota, Alaska, and New Mexico are the states most
dependent on fossil fuel revenues with at least 14% of state and local
revenues generated from the fossil fuel industry (Wyoming's dependence
is above 50%). The work makes a demonstrative statement about the link
between this revenue stream and essential services like schools, public
health, and infrastructure, but stops short of an empirical analysis
into the impact of fossil fuel decline on revenues and associated
expenditure.

**One channel through which such challenges will present themselves is
the potential hollowing out of local public revenues.** In many parts of
the United States, local well-being is heavily cointegrated with
industrial prosperity and stability, not least through the channel of
public expenditure. US revenues from fossil fuels generated about \$138
billion annually for US localities, states, tribes, and the federal
government @raimi2022 . This amount is forecast to decline by 2050 even
in a business-as-usual scenario (assuming no changes in climate policy
stringency). Wyoming, North Dakota, Alaska, and New Mexico are the
states most dependent on fossil fuel revenues with at least 14% of state
and local revenues generated from the fossil fuel industry (Wyoming's
dependence is above 50%). The work makes a demonstrative statement about
the link between this revenue stream and essential services like
schools, public health, and infrastructure, but stops short of an
empirical analysis into the impact of fossil fuel decline on revenues
and associated expenditure, even at the state level. This part of my
DPhil project aims to fill this critical evidence gap.

**Furthermore, (adding insult to injury) community well-being and public
expenditure in the US is already characterised by a high degree of
spatial heterogeneity.** Not only does the US consistently rank among
the top 5 most unequal OECD countries [^3].

[^3]: The US consistently ranks among the top 5 most unequal countries
    in the OECD alongside Turkey, Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica across
    all relevant indicators reported by the OECD: Gini coefficient,
    three interdecile income ratios (P50/P10; P90/P10; P90/P50), Palma
    ratio, S80/S20 quintile share.}, this inequality is further
    reflected in uneven and unequal quality of infrastructure,
    education, healthcare leading to real consequences for particular
    people and places @chetty2016, @logan2012, @semuels2016,
    @Avancena2021, @flavin2009 .

**One public service that has particularly important ties to ensuring
generational resilience to economic decline is education.** Public
schools around the US are responsible for educating over 80% of
school-age children. In 2019, governments around the US (including the
federal government) spent a total of \$870 billion on public education,
roughly \$17,013 per pupil @nationalcenterforeducationstatistics2023 .
However, the quality of services delivered varies widely across the
country. [^4]

[^4]: In 2016, for example, the Connecticut State Department of
    Education reported that the town of Greenwich, one of the
    highest-income towns in the country, spent \\\$8,000 more per pupil
    than Bridgeport (\\\$21.9k versus \\\$13.7k per pupil), despite both
    towns being part of the same county, located less than 40 kilometers
    apart @semuels2016 .

The quality of public education, especially at an early age, can have
long-lasting consequences for personal and economic well-being over an
individual's lifetime as well as generations following them @alfonso2020
. Therefore, ensuring that local or regional economic decline does not
disrupt or worsen the quality of education delivered to
resource-dependent communities will be of paramount importance in a
net-zero transition. [^5]

[^5]: Perhaps the most prominent and often-cited relationship between
    education and extractive industries is through the lens of the
    'resource curse.' The validity and empirical existence of a
    'resource curse' has been tested since its conception with disparate
    results [@ahlerup2020, @badeeb2017, @blanco2012, @borge2015,
    @brunnschweiler2008, @cockx2014, @cockx2016, @deacon2011,
    @dialga2022, @douglas2017, @haber, @menaldo2016, @ross2018,
    @ross2015, @sincovich2018, @wiens2014]. The literature is divided
    into two strands focusing on either political (the relationship
    between resource wealth and governance) [@ross2015, @ross2015,
    @wiens2014, @deacon2011] or economic (the relationship between
    resource wealth and economic growth or human capital) resource
    curses. Empirical investigation of the economic resource curse has
    explored the effect of resource dependence on economic growth,
    public health and education expenditure and outcomes, mainly at a
    national level [@borge2015, @cockx2016, @douglas2017,
    @sincovich2018]. In the case of education, the distinct outcome
    measured is level of educational attainment, in other words, whether
    the presence of a booming resource extraction economy provides
    disincentives to education for young people. It is worth noting that
    this literature has been repeatedly questioned on theoretical and
    conceptual grounds as institutional context often dictates whether a
    resource curse exists and empirical analyses seem to be very
    sensitive to methodological choices [@ross2018, @ross2015,
    @dialga2022]. Although awareness of this strand of literature is of
    relevance to this work, the unresolved nature of the 'debate'
    surrounding its existence requires caution if eventually utilised as
    a theoretical framework for answering the research question.

@ahlerup2020 find that for 30 countries in Africa, the presence of gold
mines during adolescence have a significant effect on educational
attainment. @badeeb2017 investigates whether resource dependence slows
economic growth with no explicit mention of education. @blanco2012 find
that in Latin America, petroleum export has a significant long-run
negative relationships with human capital. @borge2015 find support for
the paradox of plenty hypothesis in Norway - that higher local public
revenue negatively affects the efficiency of local public good
provision. @brunnschweiler2008 critically evaluate 'the empirical basis
for the so-called resource curse and find that, despite the topic's
popularity in economics and political science research, this apparent
paradox may be a red herring. The most commonly used measure of
âresource abundanceâ can be more usefully interpreted as a proxy for
âresource dependenceââendogenous to underlying structural factors. In
multiple estimations that combine resource abundance and dependence,
institutional, and constitutional variables, we find that (i) resource
abundance, constitutions, and institutions determine resource
dependence, (ii) resource dependence does not affect growth, and (iii)
resource abundance positively affects growth and institutional quality.'
@cockx2014 use a panel on 140 countries from 1995-2009 and find an
inverse relationship between resource dependence and and public health
spending over time. @cockx2016 investigate a panel of 140 countries from
1995-2009 to find an adverse effect of resource depdence on public
education expenditures relative to GDP. @dialga2022 find disparate
results for health and education controlling for institutional quality.
@douglas2017 "measure the effect of resource-sector dependence on
long-run income growth using the natural experiment of coal mining in
409 Appalachian counties selected for homogeneity. Using a panel data
set (1970â2010), we find a one standard deviation increase in resource
dependence is associated with 0.5â1 percentage point long-run and a 0.2
percentage point short-run decline in the annual growth rate of per
capita personal income. We also measure the extent to which the resource
curse operates through disincentives to education, and find significant
effects, but this âeducation channelâ explains less than 15 percent of
the apparent curse.' @haber focus on authoriarian regimes. @menaldo2016
argues again that this is an institutions curse and not a resource curse
issure. @sincovich2018 provide a literature review of resource curse
investigations in the Australian context

Altogether, this evidence points to the value of identifying the extent
to which expenditure on public education is reliant on fossil fuel
revenues in particular geographies. In other words, this work aims to
answer the following research questions:

*RQ1: To what extent are local public education systems in the United
States dependent on industrial prosperity?*

*RQ2: How can we safeguard the delivery of education as a public good
given the ineffable scale and speed of required US decarbonisation?*

In the sections that follow, I outline Section @sec-data the data to be
used in the analysis; @sec-methods the proposed methods;

## Data {#sec-data}

This work will make use of Willamette University's Annual Government
Finance Database. This resource is a harmonised repository of the data
collected annually as part of the US Census Bureau's Annual Survey of
State & Local Government Finances, the 'only comprehensive source of
information on the finances of local governments in the United States'
@pierson . I aggregate school district measures up to the county-level
to ensure the availability of adequate control and treatment variables.
[^6]

[^6]: The database is provided for six different levels of government:
    state, county, municipal, township, special district, and school
    district. Reporting is only mandated in Census years (every five
    years), and even then missing data remains a challenge. This means
    that data provided at any other level of government suffers from
    significant levels of missing data, with a high level of selection
    bias correlated with administrative capacity. However, strengthened
    by a partnership with the National Center for Education Statistics,
    observations for US school districts exhibit near-complete coverage
    between 1997-2021 @pierson . I choose to conduct the analysis on the
    commuting zone level because of a lack of availability of control
    variables at a school district level.

Thus, this dataset provides estimates in current \$USD on total public
school revenue disaggregated by source (federal, state, local
intergovernmental versus own local sources) and expenditure
disaggregated by item (level of schooling, teacher salaries, debt,
etc.). Finally, I gather GDP control variables from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA). This BEA data is only available after 2001,
therefore the panel reported and used below is restricted to 2001-2021.
This results in a complete and balanced panel of 2,710 of 3,143 US
counties between 2001-2021. [^7] [^8]

[^7]: The reason 13% of counties are missing from the dataset is because
    of (1) the exclusion criteria already outlined; (2) Hawaii and
    Alaska have been excluded due to the methodological challenge of
    incorporating their school districts into spatial econometric work;
    and (3) Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia have
    been excluded due to unconventional or incomplete public school
    district reporting. I aim to resolve this, especially in the case of
    Virginia given its relatively high rates of employment in the coal
    sector.

[^8]: Given the work's intent to rely on data on property taxes
    collected, any county that reports more than five 0 values for
    property taxes collected is excluded.

All data used is reported annually at the commuting zone level.
Therefore, no time-invariant variables are included (apart from the
State in which a commuting zone is in, which is made time-variant
through the inclusion of a state-level trend in various models). 636
commuting zones in 40 states between 2001-2021.

**Expenditure and Revenue:** The dependent variables of interest come
from [Willamette University's Government Finance
Database](https://willamette.edu/mba/research-impact/public-datasets/index.html).
The data includes commuting-zone level revenue and expenditure on public
education including disaggregated values by revenue source (federal,
state, or other intergovernmental revenue) and expenditure item
(lunches, wages, debt). All values are reported in real US dollars. The
data for property taxes collected used in regressions below also come
from this dataset. Expenditure on vocational training and from
Educational Service Agencies (ESAs) are also sourced from this dataset.

**GDP Controls:** US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Values are also
reported in current US dollars (real GDP values exist). The controls
used in the below are total, private industry, and oil, gas, mining and
quarrying commuting zone-level GDP.

**Population controls:** US Census Bureau.

**Coal mine activity and production levels:** Mine Safety and Health
Administration

First, shift-share or *Bartik* instruments have gained popularity in
empirical work as a method of handling endogeneity issues in panel data
[@ferri2022, @goldsmith-pinkham2020, @bartik1991]. Effectively, they
combine time-variant yet unit-invariant changes in aggregate economic
variables (ie., changes in national fossil fuel employment levels) with
time-invariant yet unit-variant shares in exposure to these macro-level
changes (ie., local shares of employment in fossil fuels). This
decomposition of local-level changes via a delocalisation over space and
time allows for a defensible 'de-endogenising' of the treatment.
Notably, the method can also be considered to serve a further purpose,
allowing for, by construction, the examination of a macro phenomenon's
effect on more local units.

\\footnote{Autor et al use a shift-share instrument to assess the effect
of Chinese import competition on manufacturing employment in US counties
@autor2013 . As an extension, @feler2017 use a similar shift-share
instrument to assess the effect of the same shock on the size of local
government. @baccini2021 employ a shift-share instrument for
manufacturing layoffs to tease out the effect of a decline in
manufacturing on both economically motivated and racial identity voting
patterns in the US.}

Second, an additional popular indicator for modelling industrial shocks
is *oil price* as values are often assumed to be exogenous to local and
even national conditions @scheer2022 . Third, separate from specifically
green transformation shocks, various indicators for measuring
*deindustrialisation* have been proposed including the manufacturing
share of employment, value added, and GDP [@tregenna2009,
@tregenna2020]. These deindustrialisation metrics could be used in
combination with a shift-share instrument. Finally, in rare instances,
exogeneity can be secured due to *geographical, climatological, or
geological factors*. For example, @borge2015 obtain an exogenous measure
of local revenue by "instrumenting the variation in hydropower revenue,
and thus total revenue, by topology, average precipitation and meters of
river in steep terrain." Certain authors have argued that the fact that
the location of hydrocarbon deposits is dictated by geomorphological
processes provides a plausible argument for exogeneity [@esposito2021,
@chen2022].

In order to arrive at a final estimation strategy, I plan to explore
various treatment variables to proxy industrial transformation from the
outlined alternatives. Thus far, I have employed data on coal mining
activity in a two-way fixed effects ordinary least squares framework and
an instrumental variable approach as well as constructed, although not
yet estimated, shift-share instruments using employment and wage shares
in the coal, oil and gas, and extraction sectors. I present preliminary
results from these estimation efforts below. I do not yet claim that
these results provide a causal interpretation nor that they are robustly
specified. However, I provide these results as evidence of preliminary
attempts to answer the outlined research questions as well as important
building blocks toward eventually arriving at a credible estimation
strategy.

### Coal Mining Activity

First, the Mining Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) provides data
at the mine level on activity and production. I have thus far aggregated
this data for a panel of annual county-level estimates of the number of
active coal mines and production volumes (reported in thousand short
tons) between 1996-2021. I restrict the sample to 2001-2021 to align
with the county finance
data.\footnote{I do not yet make a distinction between different types of mining or coal product (ie. surface and undeground mines; (sub)bituminous, lignite, versus anthracite coal), although such distinctions are possible using the data collected.}

## Baseline TWFE Model {#sec-methods}

### Using Standard OLS

First, I employ a two-way fixed effects ordinary least-squares panel
model with standard errors clustered by county and with and without
state-specific time trends. I outline the model specification
immediately below:

\begin{equation}
    Y_{it} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{x}X_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it} 
\label{desc_function}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
    Y_{it} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{x}X_{it} + (t-2000)*state_{i} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it} 
\label{desc_function_state_trends}
\end{equation}

$Y_{it}$ takes two values: the natural logarithm of (1) total and (2)
elementary (serving ages 6-12) education expenditure per pupil for
county $i$ in year $t$. $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_t$ represent county- and
year-fixed effects, respectively, and $\varepsilon_{it}$ represents the
error term. In Equation \ref{desc_function_state_trends},
$(t-2000)*state_{i}$ represents a state-level trend. $X_{it}$ takes six
forms with a combination of a contemporaneous and lagged control
variable (natural logarithm of private industry GDP) and contemporaneous
and lagged treatment variables (change in the volume of coal produced by
active coal mines and the number of active coal mines), where
$h = [0,2]$ in the specifications that incorporate time lagged
variables.

### Incorporating time lags

Education expenditure has a highly relevant time dependence. The effect
of increases in GDP two years prior has the greatest effect on current
education expenditure, implying a delayed effect of commuting zone-level
economic growth on public education expenditure.

Table X reports a series of fixed effects regressions estimating the association between local economic conditions and elementary education expenditure per pupil, expressed in both levels (left panel) and growth rates (right panel). Across all specifications, the results underscore the central role of intergovernmental transfers and broader local economic fundamentals in shaping patterns of education spending.

In the levels regressions, intergovernmental revenue per pupil emerges as the strongest and most consistent predictor of education expenditure. A 1% increase in intergovernmental transfers is associated with approximately a 0.35â0.38% increase in per-pupil education spending, controlling for unit and year fixed effects. This finding highlights the importance of state and federal aid in sustaining local education budgets. Lagged economic indicators, particularly private industry GDP and average weekly wages, are also positively and significantly associated with education spending. The magnitude of the coefficients increases with the number of lags, suggesting a gradual adjustment process by which local economic growth translates into higher public investment in education over time. For example, a 1% increase in lagged (tâ2) real private GDP per capita is associated with a 0.14% increase in per-pupil spending, while lagged wage growth shows similar cumulative effects.

The house price index also enters positively and significantly in contemporaneous and short-lag specifications (up to tâ3), but its influence diminishes and turns negative at longer lags. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that local housing markets influence education budgets through changes in property tax bases and local fiscal capacity, but that these effects are most salient in the short run and may attenuate over time due to institutional lags in budgeting and allocation.

The growth rate regressions, while explaining less variance overall (as expected), largely confirm the patterns observed in the levels specifications. Intergovernmental revenue growth remains a strong and highly significant determinant of education expenditure growth, with coefficients ranging from 0.33 to 0.40. Lagged wage and GDP growth also emerge as important predictors, particularly at longer lags. Notably, wage growth two years prior is associated with a 0.31% increase in education spending growth, suggesting that labor market improvements take time to materialize in local education budgets. Growth in house prices also predicts increases in education spending, but these effects are concentrated in the contemporaneous and first-lag specifications.

Taken together, these results offer three key insights. First, public education investment is strongly mediated by external fiscal flows, reaffirming the role of intergovernmental transfers in equalizing local education finance. Second, local labor market conditionsâcaptured through wages and GDPâexert lagged, cumulative effects on education spending, consistent with fiscal inertia and political delays in budgetary response. Third, local housing markets play a more modest and short-term role in shaping education budgets, reflecting the link between property values and tax revenues, but also potential constraints in translating asset wealth into public service provision.

From a policy perspective, the findings highlight the importance of designing school finance systems that are responsive to both the timing and structure of economic change. Given the lagged transmission from labor market improvements to education investment, reliance on local economic conditions alone may exacerbate disparities in educational funding across space and time. Mechanisms that smooth fiscal shocks or front-load investment in response to projected economic growth could help ensure that educational resources more closely track the evolving needs of communities.

## Instrumental Variable Approach

There is a significant endogeneity concern in using wage growth as the
treatment variable. Therefore, I have tried two instrumental variable
approaches below and aim to add results using production- and
employment-based Bartik instruments.

A critical break-through in this work came from understanding the
structure of public financing (described in further detail in Section
\ref{si_section:Challenges} of the Supplementary Materials). In brief,
revenue for public education comes from a combination of
intergovernmental and local sources and revenue generated from local
sources comes almost entirely from property taxes. Given this, I can
isolate the channel through which I assume our treatment (industrial
production) will affect our outcome variable using an instrumental
variable approach. I provide the results of an initial attempt at this
theory below including the functional form and underlying theoretical
path diagram of the econometric specification.

We consider using XX as an instrument affecting education expenditure
through property taxes or GDP. We know that property taxes have an
endogenous relationship with education expenditure, however, in theory,
XX is unlikely to affect education expenditure, except via property
taxes. We test this hypothesis below.

As a reminder, the intuition behind the idea is

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\caption{Instrumental Variable Path Diagram}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% nodes %
\node[rectangle] (z) at (0,0) {Instrument};
\node (t) at (4,0) {Property Values};
\node (y) at (8,0) {Education Expenditure};
\node (u) at (4,2) {Omitted variable};

\draw[->, line width=1, red, dashed] (u) -- (y);
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{fig:iv_approach}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:iv_approach}, I hypothesize that property
taxes have an effect on education expenditure. However, there is
significant concern of a reverse causal effect as higher income families
likely gravitate towards school districts with higher levels of
expenditure per pupil, driving up property values. However, we assume
that coal mining activity has no other effect on education expenditure
except through the channel of property taxes.

A more commonly used identification strategy is via a shift-share or
Bartik instrument. A shift-share instrument interacts local industry
shares with national industry-level growth rates to attain a plausibly
exogenous local shock. In the context of this work, we intend to create
a unit-specific time-varying treatment variable by interacting a
unit-specific, time-invariant industrial employment share variable with
a national-level time-varying wage growth rate.

$Y_{it}$ takes the same two values as above. $Z_{i,t}$ takes the value
of either active coal production or the number of active coal mines in
county $i$ in year $t$. I further test for a time lagged effect and run
alternate specifications where a one- and two-year lag $Z_{i,t}$
replaces the contemporaneous value. $X_{i,t}$ is the amount of property
taxes collected per pupil in county $i$ in year $t$.

The literature on Bartik instruments derives plausible exogeneity from
two sources. First, authors argue that local industry shares are
exogenous by imposing that shares be fixed to a particular base year and
are therefore unable to adapt to changes in national-level growth rates.
Such a shift-share instrument would look as follows:

\begin{equation}
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{ij\tau}G_{njt}
\end{equation}

where $S_{ij0}$ is the local share of unit $i$'s economy (potentially
measured by metrics like employment, wages, revenue) in industry $j$ at
a fixed base year $\tau$ and $G_{njt}$ is the growth rate of industry
$j$ at a national level $n$ at time $t$.

Alternatively, authors may argue that the national-level growth rates
are exogenous allowing the shares to vary over time, constructing the
shift-share instrument as follows:

\begin{equation}
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{ijt}G_{njt}
\end{equation}

Finally, authors might be concerned about the implausible exogeneity of
both shares and national-level growth rates in which case they could
construct the instrument as follows where the local shares are fixed at
a common base year and industry-specific growth rates $G$ are derived
from data on other similar regions $o$ rather than national-level
changes that are inherently comprised of local-level shifts. This
approach likely comes at significant expense to instrument relevance.

\begin{equation}
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{0jt}G_{ojt}
\end{equation}

Finally, the authors can make an additional design choice about whether
the effect of these instruments should be assumed common to an aggregate
local-level wage growth indicator or allowed to vary by industry. In
other words, whether to construct the first-stage relationship of the
2SLS as:

\begin{equation}
X_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta\sum_{j=1}^{k}S_{\*j\*}G_{\*j} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
X_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1}^{k}\beta_{j}S_{\star j \star}G_{\star jt} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

```{r, include = FALSE}

# getspanel
# isatpanel(data = mines_cz,
#           formula = "Total_Educ_Total_Exp_pp ~ gdp_total_pc + gdp_priv_ind_pc + gdp_o_g_mining_quarr_21_pc + gdp_govt_pc",

#          t.pval =0.01
#          # SIS = TRUE
#           )

```

### Shift-share Instrument

Finally, using data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), I have constructed a total of six
shift-share Bartik instruments across two metrics (employment and wage)
for three sectoral aggregations (oil and gas, coal, and all extractive
industries) at the county-level. Figure @fig-bartik_graph above
shows the shift-share instrument by county from 2001-2021. Equation
\ref{bartik} demonstrates the Bartik instrument as outlined in
@ferri2022 and @goldsmith-pinkham2020 and defined in @bartik1991 .
$\Delta X_{t,s}$ represents national-level changes in either employment
or wages in industry $s$ in time $t$ and
$\frac{N_{i,\tau, s}}{N_{i,\tau}}$ represents the \`\`sensitivity'' of a
county to these national shocks proxied by an initial share of local
employment or wage in industry $s$ in a baseline time period $\tau$. The
product of these two values defines the shift-share indicator
$\tilde{X}_{i,t,s}$. In Figure @fig-bartik_graph, I demonstrate the
wage- and employment-based shift-share instruments (each line represents
a separate county) using a base period $\tau$ = 2001. [^9]

[^9]: We explore the sensitivity of results to the choice of base period
    $\tau$ by constructing the instrument for various base periods as
    well as a rolling window.

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{X}_{i,t,s} = \Delta X_{t,s} *  \frac{N_{i,\tau, s}}{N_{i,\tau}}
\label{bartik}

The instrumental variable estimates provide evidence of a robust causal relationship between national labor demand shocks and local housing prices. Utilizing a shift-share instrument that interacts national industry-specific wage growth rates with local industrial exposure (proxied through property values), the first-stage regression yields a statistically significant and economically large coefficient. A one-unit increase in the shift-share measure is associated with a 50.4% increase in the local House Price Index (p < 0.01), with an F-statistic of 217.9âwell above conventional weak instrument thresholdsâconfirming instrument relevance. However, the second-stage results indicate no statistically significant effect of instrumented housing wealth on local education expenditure per pupil. Conditional on intergovernmental revenues and local GDP per capita, the coefficient on log HPI is small in magnitude and not statistically distinguishable from zero. These findings suggest that while labor demand shocks substantially affect local housing markets through capitalized expectations and asset price adjustments, they do not necessarily translate into commensurate changes in public investment in elementary education, at least in the short-to-medium term.

The lack of a causal link between housing wealth and public education spending highlights potential institutional rigidities in the fiscal transmission mechanism linking local economic conditions to public goods provision. In many U.S. localities, school finance systems remain only partially responsive to contemporaneous changes in the property tax base due to funding caps, state-level equalization formulas, or lags in budget-setting processes. As a result, the benefits of local labor market boomsâreflected in rising property valuesâmay be disproportionately captured by homeowners and landlords without being redistributed through improved public services. This creates a disconnect between private wealth accumulation and collective investment, with implications for the spatial distribution of educational opportunity. In areas where property values increase due to industry-specific wage growth, the absence of corresponding increases in education spending may exacerbate existing inequalities, especially in regions with historically lower fiscal capacity or institutional autonomy.

From a policy perspective, these results underscore the limitations of relying on localized property tax bases to fund essential public services in the context of an increasingly uneven and geographically concentrated labor market. The structure of shift-share instruments inherently leverages exogenous national variation in labor demand, but the outcomes indicate that even sizable positive economic shocks at the local level are insufficient to trigger automatic increases in education expenditure. This finding reinforces concerns about the decoupling of local economic gains from public service provision, particularly in jurisdictions that lack flexible or progressive fiscal institutions. Without deliberate policy mechanisms to translate housing market windfalls into educational investmentsâsuch as automatic stabilizers, revised state aid formulas, or property tax reformâthe gains from macroeconomic growth may fail to improve educational equity or intergenerational mobility in affected regions.

### Declining vs. Growing Regions

What would be great is to be able to econometrically test when a
commuting zone is "declining." In the first step, it would be good to
identify when a commuting zone is declining overall (GDP, poverty, etc)
but ideally eventually apply this to the education outcome. My hope is
that being able to identify counties that are "declining" we can either
use this variable as a covariate or as a central point of analysis. The
below analysis looks at state-level variables as a first step (mainly to
aid in visual comparison and plotting). Ideally, once a method is
decided on this would be applied to commuting zone-level data which
would need to be summarise/collated in some way for plotting.

         real_gdp_total_pc = real_gdp_total/pop_total,
         across(!c(state, year), ~log(. + 1), .names = "log_{.col}")) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("log"), ~.- dplyr::lag(., 1), .names = "diff_{.col}")) %>%

### Removing outliers - really high-income commuting zones!

As you can see in the scatterplot below, there is a somewhat non-linear
relationship between property taxes and elementary expenditure as
property taxes collected rise. This happens largely as a result of very
high-income commuting zones. Therefore, I exclude any commuting zone
that spends more than 28k per pupil to avoid any distorting effects.
This removes 12 counties (\~2% of the sample) This could benefit from
more robust outlier detection. This outlier exclusion weakens our
results (and the validity of our instrument choice) in the
production-based IV regression. Worth noting and thinking about!!

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}

mines_no_outliers <- mines_cz %>%
  group_by(unit) %>%

The determinants of inequality in public education delivery in the US
are multiple and complex. Significant evidence exists of the role of
historically discriminatory policies related to congressional
districting, under-investment in low-income areas of color. Though this
work does not directly inform this debate, further work could explore
the extent to which wage growth interacts with such structural policies.
