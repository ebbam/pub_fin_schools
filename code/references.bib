	abstract = {We offer a unified analysis of the growth of low-skill service
occupations between 1980 and 2005 and the concurrent polarization
of US employment and wages. We hypothesize that polarization
stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which
favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating
routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we
corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets
that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information
technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations
(employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails
of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled
labor.},
