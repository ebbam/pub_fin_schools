\begin{abstract}
Over recent decades, the United States has experienced increasingly
divergent patterns of economic and wage growth. Wage growth is a key
driver of local wealth accumulation, enabling greater household and
community investment in public goods. Regions whose wages track
productivity gains likely benefit from broader economic growth,
accumulating wealth that sustains local public services, while lagging
regions risk weaker savings rates and eroding fiscal capacities. We
estimate how divergent wage growth across U.S. regions affects public
education expenditure using a shift-share instrumental variable design.
Accounting for state-level heterogeneity in tax regimes, income, and
economic growth, we find substantial variation in the elasticity of
education spending to wages: the magnitude and statistical significance
differ markedly across states. This heterogeneity explains the majority
of spending responses and reflects both uneven economic fundamentals and
diverse fiscal institutions that generate inequality in public goods
provision. Our results demonstrate that average treatment effects in
panel studies can obscure critical policy-relevant variation. The
findings suggest that federal and local policies assuming uniform
wage-spending relationships may fail to address or even exacerbate
pervasive spatial inequality in educational investment.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\textbf{Since the 1970s, a persistent divergence between productivity
growth and wage growth has emerged in the United States ( Hoffmann, Lee,
and Lemieux (2020), Stansbury and Summers (n.d.), Economic Policy
Institute (n.d.)).} While labour productivity has continued to rise, the
earnings of typical workers have increased far more slowly, leading to a
substantial decoupling between the two trends. Economists cite various
contributors to this phenomenon from human capital (Autor (2014), Katz
and Murphy (1992)) to competition (Stansbury and Summers (n.d.), Deb et
al. (2022), Yeh, Macaluso, and Hershbein (2022), Azar, Marinescu, and
Steinbaum (2022), (\textbf{autor2013a?}) , Wilmers (2018)) to
institutional and policy forces (Egger, Nigai, and Strecker (2019), Lee
(1999), Mishel and Bivens (2021), Barkai (2020), Autor, Manning, and
Smith (2016), Card (2001)).\footnote{Summers and Stansbury (2018) argue
  that productivity growth still exerts a positive influence on wages
  overall, but that institutional and structural changes have weakened
  the link for large segments of the workforce. They point to declining
  union density, erosion of the minimum wage, globalization, and
  increased market concentration as key factors that have shifted
  bargaining power away from workers and reduced labour's share of
  national income Autor (2014). Furthermore, additional evidence finds
  that this decoupling is far from a universal phenomenon. Rather,
  decoupling applies almost strictly to lower- and medium-wage earners,
  while already higher wages manage to keep up (relatively) with
  productivity growth rates.} Though its causes are hotly debated, the
fact itself is well-documented, especially for lower- and middle-income
workers. \footnote{Though authors find that wage inequality growth has
  stagnated in the last decade this is not a result of a ``catch-up''
  effect of lower- or middle-income earners with top income earners, but
  rather wage growth at the bottom of the wage distribution Aeppli and
  Wilmers (2022).}

\textbf{The direct consequences of this decoupling are clear.} Though
households and individuals often have stakes in firm productivity by
means other than wages, wages remain the most direct link between
aggregate national productivity growth and local economic health.
Therefore, aggregate productivity growth is not sufficient to secure
broad-based improvements in living standards if the most direct link
between productivity and livelihoods (wages) is weak. The benefits of
economic growth have already accrued unevenly across communities in the
United States. Economic history and industrial activity have
heterogeneously impacted the development trajectories of US regions (
Fee (2025), Storper and Scott (2009) ).

\textbf{A link that has been far less explored in this context is the
spillover effect of local wages to local wealth-building and its effect
on public goods.} Wage growth is an important contributor to local
wealth-building, allowing households and communities to invest more in
local public goods. Communities whose wages rise in line with
productivity growth will likely reap the benefits of economic growth
whereas those who do not, risk falling behind. This link is particularly
important in the US given the structure of local public financing.
Majority of local public services are funded via property taxes. This
funding structure entrenches a mechanism for generating inequality of
opportunity between diversely affluent regions of the country. Put
plainly, given the structure of US public services, wherein they are
funded largely through property taxes and thus tied to asset values,
inequality in wealth-building can have significant effects for the
quality of local public services.

\textbf{Community well-being and public expenditure in the US is already
characterised by a high degree of spatial heterogeneity.} Evidence of
how income and wealth inequality perpetuate other forms of inequality
(opportunity, health, infrastructure quality, and broader well-being) is
steadily increasing (Chetty et al. (2016), Logan, Minca, and Adar
(2012), Semuels (2016), Avanceña et al. (2021), Flavin et al. (2009)).
Boustan et al. (2013) find that greater income inequality leads to
higher public expenditure across all public goods indicating that a
presence of higher-earners in a local area contributes to higher levels
of expenditure. Though this does not support an unambiguous denunciation
of inequality in itself, it provides additional evidence for the fact
that local incomes affect public expenditure raising the potential for
``superstar'' and ``left behind'' regions to emerge absent even income
growth.

(Manduca 2025, Feler \& Senses 2017)

\textbf{One public service that has particularly important ties to
ensuring generational resilience to economic decline is education.}
Public schools around the US are responsible for educating over 80\% of
school-age children. In 2019, governments around the US (including the
federal government) spent a total of \$870 billion on public education,
roughly \$17,013 per pupil (National Center for Education Statistics
(2023)) . However, the quality of services delivered varies widely
across the country. In 2016, for example, the Connecticut State
Department of Education reported that the town of Greenwich, one of the
highest-income towns in the country, spent \$8,000 more per pupil than
Bridgeport (\$21.9k versus \$13.7k per pupil), despite both towns being
part of the same county, located less than 40 kilometers apart (Semuels
(2016)), and competing in academic and extra-curricular activities.

(Zheng \& Graham, Biolsi 2022)

\textbf{The quality of public education, especially at an early age, can
have long-lasting consequences for personal and economic well-being over
an individual's lifetime as well as generations following them (Alfonso
and DuPaul (2020)).} Therefore, ensuring that local or regional economic
decline does not disrupt or worsen the quality of education delivered is
of paramount importance to ensure greater equality in the long-run.
\footnote{Perhaps the most prominent and often-cited relationship
  between education and extractive industries is through the lens of the
  `resource curse.' The validity and empirical existence of a `resource
  curse' has been tested since its conception with disparate results
  Wiens, Poast, and Clark (2014). The literature is divided into two
  strands focusing on either political (the relationship between
  resource wealth and governance) Deacon (2011) or economic (the
  relationship between resource wealth and economic growth or human
  capital) resource curses. Empirical investigation of the economic
  resource curse has explored the effect of resource dependence on
  economic growth, public health and education expenditure and outcomes,
  mainly at a national level Sincovich et al. (2018). In the case of
  education, the distinct outcome measured is level of educational
  attainment, in other words, whether the presence of a booming resource
  extraction economy provides disincentives to education for young
  people. It is worth noting that this literature has been repeatedly
  questioned on theoretical and conceptual grounds as institutional
  context often dictates whether a resource curse exists and empirical
  analyses seem to be very sensitive to methodological choices Dialga
  and Ouoba (2022). Although awareness of this strand of literature is
  of relevance to this work, the unresolved nature of the `debate'
  surrounding its existence requires caution if eventually utilised as a
  theoretical framework for answering the research question.}
\footnote{Ahlerup, Baskaran, and Bigsten (2020) find that for 30
  countries in Africa, the presence of gold mines during adolescence
  have a significant effect on educational attainment. Badeeb, Lean, and
  Clark (2017) investigates whether resource dependence slows economic
  growth with no explicit mention of education. Blanco and Grier (2012)
  find that in Latin America, petroleum export has a significant
  long-run negative relationships with human capital. Borge, Parmer, and
  Torvik (2015) find support for the paradox of plenty hypothesis in
  Norway - that higher local public revenue negatively affects the
  efficiency of local public good provision. Brunnschweiler and Bulte
  (2008) critically evaluate `the empirical basis for the so-called
  resource curse and find that, despite the topic's popularity in
  economics and political science research, this apparent paradox may be
  a red herring. The most commonly used measure of ``resource
  abundance'' can be more usefully interpreted as a proxy for ``resource
  dependence''-endogenous to underlying structural factors. In multiple
  estimations that combine resource abundance and dependence,
  institutional, and constitutional variables, we find that (i) resource
  abundance, constitutions, and institutions determine resource
  dependence, (ii) resource dependence does not affect growth, and (iii)
  resource abundance positively affects growth and institutional
  quality.' Cockx and Francken (2014) use a panel on 140 countries from
  1995-2009 and find an inverse relationship between resource dependence
  and and public health spending over time. Cockx and Francken (2016)
  investigate a panel of 140 countries from 1995-2009 to find an adverse
  effect of resource depdence on public education expenditures relative
  to GDP. Dialga and Ouoba (2022) find disparate results for health and
  education controlling for institutional quality. Douglas and Walker
  (2017) ``measure the effect of resource-sector dependence on long-run
  income growth using the natural experiment of coal mining in 409
  Appalachian counties selected for homogeneity. Using a panel data set
  (1970--2010), we find a one standard deviation increase in resource
  dependence is associated with 0.5--1 percentage point long-run and a
  0.2 percentage point short-run decline in the annual growth rate of
  per capita personal income. We also measure the extent to which the
  resource curse operates through disincentives to education, and find
  significant effects, but this ``education channel'' explains less than
  15 percent of the apparent curse.' Haber (n.d.) focus on authoriarian
  regimes. Menaldo (2016) argues again that this is an institutions
  curse and not a resource curse issure. Sincovich et al. (2018) provide
  a literature review of resource curse investigations in the Australian
  context.} {[}\^{}6{]} Altogether, this evidence points to the value of
identifying the extent to which expenditure on public education is
reliant on local wage growth across the country.

\textbf{Expenditure numbers matter for education quality/outcomes.}
(Baker 2016, Jackson 2016),

\textbf{This study therefore determines whether elasticities of public
elementary education expenditure to local wage growth are non-zero.} If
productivity gains translate unevenly into wages across industries and
regions, then the fiscal capacity of local governments may be shaped as
much by institutional and structural conditions as by aggregate economic
growth. We answer the following questions:

\emph{RQ1:} Do local wage gains affect public education expenditure?

\emph{RQ2:} If so, is this relationship constant across commuting zones?
What sources of heterogeneity mediate this relationship?

\emph{RQ3:} In light of reforms to intergovernmental education funding
to alleviate uneven educational expenditure, do intergovernmental
transfers alleviate wealth-driven inequalities in public education
expenditure?

The elasticity of public education expenditure to local wages has
ambiguous interpretation that depend on various possible fiscal
priorities (wording?) and possible substitution effects. A positive
elasticity would suggest that higher wages increase household savings
rates and willingness to invest in local public goods, consistent with
standard wealth effects. However, this relationship raises concerns
about possible divergence wherein wage growth in high-earning regions
could amplify educational investment, potentially widening spatial
inequality in public education quality.

Conversely, a negative elasticity could emerge through several channels.
Any response in needs-based intergovernmental revenue mechanisms may
partially offset local fiscal capacity, creating an inverse relationship
between wages and education spending. Alternatively, in more affluent
communities, rising wages may enable households to substitute towards
private education, crowding out or reducing demand for public
expenditure. Furthermore, such a relationship could provide additional
empirical support for a ``resource curse'' dynamic wherein local
communities reprioritise fiscal windfalls toward government expenditure
other than in public education. (Cite Texas Shale Boom Paper).

In either case, the consequence of a non-zero elasticity, whether
positive or negative, has potential adverse consequences for spatial
inequality of public education delivery by either boosting public
education in affluent areas or dampening investment in less affluent
areas.

Finally, a near-zero elasticity either has a modelling or
policy-relevant implication. On the modelling side, a near-zero
elasticity could indicate either that wage-public goods relationship
operates on a longer time scale than that examined in this work. This
would indicate the need for an alternative identification strategy.
Alternatively, a near-zero elasticity could indicate that local public
education systems are effectively insulated from local wage changes
partly because intergovernmental transfers successfully equalise funding
across regions.

\subsection{Theoretical Motivation and Empirical
Approach}\label{theoretical-motivation-and-empirical-approach}

This work interrogates the elasticity of public education expenditure to
uneven economic and wage growth across US commuting zones.

We construct a shift-share (Bartik) instrument that combines fixed local
industry employment shares with national industry-level changes in wages
and real value added. Following the established literature (Bartik 1991;
Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift 2020; Ferri 2022), we fix local
employment shares to a baseline period and interact them with national
growth rates in industry real value added. Using data from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis, we construct
commuting-zone-level Bartik instruments based on both outcomes. This
provides a credible and transparent identification strategy that links
macroeconomic shocks to local education funding.

This strategy generates plausibly exogenous local variation by
exploiting how different regions are differentially exposed to common
national trends, while abstracting from endogenous local dynamics. It is
particularly well suited in this setting, since the local tax base, and
thus education spending, depends heavily on industries that are unevenly
distributed across regions but likely subject to similar
industry-specific wage shocks. Finally, we use this instrument to
identify the effect of wage shocks on local public education expenditure
as reported in a panel dataset from the Annual Survey of State and Local
Government Finances.

The outlined instrumental variable strategy tackles the central
endogeneity challenge present in any study of the linkage between two or
more local socio-economic outcomes. In the context of this study, wages
and public education expenditure are undoubtedly endogenous, since
higher-income families may self-select into districts with greater
education spending, confounding causal inference. Therefore, we
instrument local wages with the constructed shift-share instruments to
circumvent this challenge allowing for plausibly causal inference.

Given the substantial heterogeneity across U.S. states arising both from
structural sources (such as differences in tax systems, regulatory
environments, and legislative institutions) and from evolved
characteristics (including industrial composition, income levels,
inequality, and broader measures of economic diversity) the scope for
identifying a single, well-defined national average treatment effect is
inherently limited. We provide an initial benchmark using a pooled
estimation to establish baseline relationships between wages, GDP, and
asset values that appear to generalize reasonably across the national
economy, before investigating the heterogeneity that these pooled
estimates mask in our main analysis. We further advance this analysis
via state-by-state and industry-by-industry estimations and group
commuting zones by their historic growth trajectories to improve
comparability of treatment and control groups in our instrumental
variable design.

\subsection{Detailed results}\label{detailed-results}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Public education expenditure is not agnostic to local economic
  conditions. We establish a strong causal link between public education
  expenditure and local wages using a shift-share instrumental variable
  estimation, and subsequently for specific industries and states and
  growth cohorts. The estimated treatment effect of local wages on
  public education expenditure varies in magnitude, and statistical
  significance across states.
\item
  Estimating the instrumental variable model separately for each state
  reveals substantial heterogeneity in the relationship between wages
  and education expenditure. Less than 10 of the 40 states analysed in
  this study show persistent causal relationships between wages and
  education expenditure, indicating that these carry the weight of
  national-level identification.

\subsection{Roadmap}\label{roadmap}

In the sections that follow, we outline in Section~\ref{sec-data} the
data to be used in the analysis; Section~\ref{sec-methods} the
methodological approach with accompanying results;
Section~\ref{sec-discussion} and Section~\ref{sec-conclusion} provide a
discussion and concluding remarks.

\section{Data}\label{sec-data}

We compile a panel dataset of the following indicators across 636
commuting zones (CZ) in 41 US states between 2001-2021.

\textbf{Expenditure and Revenue:} This work employs Willamette
University's Annual Government Finance Database at the commuting zone
(CZ) level. This resource is a harmonised repository of the data
collected annually as part of the US Census Bureau's Annual Survey of
State \& Local Government Finances, the `only comprehensive source of
information on the finances of local governments in the United States'
(Pierson, Hand, and Thompson (n.d.)). The data includes commuting-zone
level revenue and expenditure on public education including
disaggregated values by revenue source (federal, state, or other
intergovernmental revenue) and expenditure item (lunches, wages, debt).
All values are reported in real US dollars. The data for property taxes
collected used in the regressions below also come from this dataset.
Expenditure on vocational training and from Educational Service Agencies
(ESAs) are also sourced from this dataset. We aggregate school district
measures up to the commuting zone-level to ensure the availability of
adequate control and treatment variables. \footnote{The database is
  provided for six different levels of government: state, county,
  municipal, township, special district, and school district. Reporting
  is only mandated in Census years (every five years), and even then
  missing data remains a challenge. This means that data provided at any
  other level of government suffers from significant levels of missing
  data, with a high level of selection bias correlated with
  administrative capacity. However, strengthened by a partnership with
  the National Center for Education Statistics, observations for US
  school districts exhibit near-complete coverage between 1997-2021
  (Pierson, Hand, and Thompson (n.d.)). We choose to conduct the
  analysis on the commuting zone level because (1) it is a more accurate
  picture of a local labor market area (Carpenter, Lotspeich-Yadao, and
  Tolbert (2022)) and (2) a lack of availability of control variables at
  a school district level.}

Thus, this dataset provides estimates in \$USD on total public school
revenue disaggregated by source (federal, state, local intergovernmental
versus own local sources) and expenditure disaggregated by item (level
of schooling, teacher salaries, debt, etc.).

\textbf{Population controls:} US Census Bureau.

\textbf{GDP Controls:} We gather GDP control variables from the Bureau
of Economic Analysis (BEA). This BEA data is only available after 2001,
therefore the panel reported and used below is restricted from
2001-2021. The controls used in the below are commuting zone-level
private industry GDP. We decide to use private industry GDP as a control
variable given a large remaining portion of GDP is government
expenditure which includes public education expenditure.

\textbf{Property Prices:} The US Federal Housing Finance Agency provides
geographically linked data on single-family house prices called the
Housing Price Index. HPI is a broad measure of the movement of
single-family house prices. The FHFA HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales
index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or
refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by
reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose
mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac (two US government-sponsored enterprises that guarantee most US
mortgages) since January 1975
\href{https://www.fhfa.gov/data/hpi}{(Source)}. It is reported at the
county level at an annual frequency. We aggregate to the commuting zone
level via a mean.

\textbf{Race Controls:} The National Institute of Health National Cancer
Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program
provides annual estimates of total White, Black, American Indian/Alaska
Native, Asian/Pacific Islander populations at the county level,
optionally by Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin. Though the US Census
Bureau provides county-level estimates of racial make-up of local areas
in the American Community Survey, this data is unavailable prior to 2009
and is considered less accurate than those provided by the National
Cancer Institute's SEER Database.

This data aggregation results in a complete and balanced panel of 636 US
commuting zones across 40 states between 2001-2021. \footnote{The reason
  13\% of all US CZs are missing from the dataset is because of (1) the
  exclusion criteria already outlined; (2) Hawaii and Alaska have been
  excluded due to the methodological challenge of incorporating their
  school districts into spatial econometric work; and (3) Connecticut,
  Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia have been excluded due to
  unconventional or incomplete public school district reporting.}
\footnote{Given the work's intent to rely on data on property taxes
  collected, any CZ that reports more than five 0 values for property
  taxes collected is excluded.} All data used is reported annually at
the commuting zone level. \footnote{In line with similar work on US
  economic geography, commuting zones were chosen as the unit of
  analysis as they are a far less arbitrary and more accurate

\subsection{Identification Strategy}\label{identification-strategy}

We are centrally interested in the effect of changes in local wages on
public education expenditure. There is a significant endogeneity concern
in using local wages as a treatment variable for two reasons: (1) the
likely attracting factor of high levels of education expenditure for
higher-income families and, (2) absent migration, education systems
provision local labour markets with individuals with diverse human
capital. Therefore, we instrument local wages using a shift-share based
instrument of real value added across 19 industrial categories.

Shift-share or \emph{Bartik} instruments have gained popularity in
empirical work as a method of handling endogeneity issues in panel data
(Ferri (2022), Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2020), Bartik
(1991)). Such instruments combine time-variant, unit-invariant changes
in aggregate economic variables (ie., national changes in industry wage
levels) with time-invariant, unit-variant shares in exposure to these
macro-level changes (ie., local shares of employment in particular
industries). This decomposition of local-level changes via a
delocalisation over space and time allows for a defensible
`de-endogenising' of the treatment. Notably, the method can also be
considered to serve a further purpose as, by construction, it allows for
the examination of a macro phenomenon's effect on more local units.

\footnote{Autor et al. use a shift-share instrument to assess the effect
of Chinese import competition on manufacturing employment in US
commuting zones (@autor2013). As an extension, @feler2017 use a similar
shift-share instrument to assess the effect of the same shock on the
size of local government. @baccini2021 employ a shift-share instrument
for manufacturing layoffs to tease out the effect of a decline in
manufacturing on both economically motivated and racial identity voting
patterns in the US.}
\footnote{An additional popular indicator for modelling industrial shocks
is *oil price* as values are often assumed to be exogenous to local and
even national conditions (@scheer2022). Third, various indicators for measuring
*deindustrialisation* have been proposed including the manufacturing
share of employment, value added, and GDP [@tregenna2009,
@tregenna2020]. Finally, in rare instances,
exogeneity can be secured due to *geographical, climatological, or
geological factors*. For example, @borge2015 obtain an exogenous measure
of local revenue by "instrumenting the variation in hydropower revenue,
and thus total revenue, by topology, average precipitation and meters of
river in steep terrain." Certain authors have argued that the fact that
the location of hydrocarbon deposits is dictated by geomorphological
processes provides a plausible argument for exogeneity [@esposito2021,
@chen2022].}

Therefore, we adopt an identification strategy via a shift-share
instrument. A shift-share instrument interacts local industry shares
with national industry-level growth rates to obtain a plausibly
exogenous local shock. In the context of this work, we construct the
instrument by interacting a commuting-zone level constant industrial
employment share variable with national industry-level real value added
data.

The literature on Bartik instruments allows for an argument of plausible
exogeneity via various channels. First, authors argue that local
industry shares are exogenous by imposing that shares be fixed to a
particular base year and are therefore unable to adapt to changes in
national-level growth rates. Such a shift-share instrument would look as
follows:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ref-bartik}{
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{ij\tau}G_{njt}
}\end{equation}

where \(S_{ij\tau}\) is the local share of unit \(i\)'s economy
(measured using metrics like employment, wages, revenue) in industry
\(j\) at a fixed base year \(\tau\) and \(G_{njt}\) is the growth rate
of industry \(j\) at a national level \(n\) at time \(t\).

Alternatively, authors may argue that the claim of exogeneity in the
national-level growth rates is unlikely to be violated even when
allowing the local shares to vary over time. This approach is likely to
come at significant expense to instrument exogeneity. It is constructed
as follows:

\[
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{ijt}G_{njt}
\]

Finally, authors might be concerned about the implausible exogeneity of
both shares and national-level growth rates in which case they could
construct the instrument as follows where the local shares are fixed at
a common base year and industry-specific growth rates \(G\) are derived
from data on other similar regions \(o\) rather than national-level
changes that are inherently comprised of local-level shifts. This
approach likely comes at significant expense to instrument relevance.

\[
Z_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} S_{0jt}G_{ojt}
\]

Finally, the authors can make an additional design choice about whether
the effect of these instruments should be assumed common to an aggregate
local-level wage growth indicator or allowed to vary by industry. In
other words, whether to construct the first-stage relationship of the
2SLS as\ldots:

\[
X_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta\sum_{j=1}^{k}S_{ijt}G_{njt} + \epsilon_{it}
\]

\ldots or\ldots:

\[
X_{it} = \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1}^{k}\beta_{j}S_{j}G_{jt} + \epsilon_{it}
\]

We choose to employ the first of these options, assuming that industry
shares are only exogenous at a given base period and that national level
growth rates are exogenous and therefore allowed to vary with time.

Using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, we construct a
shift-share Bartik instruments at the commuting zone level using local
employment shares by industry and national changes in industry-specific
real value added represented in Equation~\ref{eq-bartik}. \(G_{njt}\)
represents national-level changes in value added in industry \(j\) in
time \(t\) and \(\frac{N_{ij\tau}}{N_{i\tau}}\) represents the
`sensitivity' of a CZ to these national shocks proxied by an initial
share of local employment in industry \(j\) in a baseline time period
\(\tau\). The product of these two values defines the shift-share
indicator \(\tilde{Z}_{i,t,s}\). In order to construct the share
portion, we compute the total local share of employment in a particular
industry \(j\). Due to challenges with missing data, we compute an
average share across 2001-2005 as our `base year'.

In the Appendices, we provide an additional estimation using a
wage-based shift-share instrument constructed using data from the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
(QCEW). This shift-share instrument is constructed as described above
using industry-level changes in real wages. Concerns about endogeneity
are greater using this shift-share instrument and is therefore excluded
from the main text.

\footnote{We explore the sensitivity of results to the choice of base period
    $\tau$ by constructing the instrument for various base periods as
    well as a rolling window.}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bartik}{
    \tilde{Z}_{it} = \sum_{j=1}^{k}G_{njt} *  \frac{N_{ij\tau}}{N_{i\tau}} 
}\end{equation}

This yields a 2SLS AR(1) model defined by the first- and second-stage
regressions represented in Equation~\ref{eq-first-stage} and
Equation~\ref{eq-second-stage}. Due to the likely presence of
time-dynamic effects, we include contemporaneous, 1-year, 2-year time
lags as instruments.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-first-stage}{
\textbf{(First stage)}\qquad
X_{it} \;=\; \phi\,X_{i,t-1} \;+\; \sum_{\ell=0}^{2}\pi_{\ell}\,\tilde Z_{i,t-\ell}
\;+\; \boldsymbol{\theta}\mathbf{W}_{it}' \;+\; \alpha_i \;+\; \lambda_t \;+\; u_{it},
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-second-stage}{
\textbf{(Second stage)}\qquad
Y_{it} \;=\; \phi^\ast \,Y_{i,t-1} \;+\; \beta\,\widehat{X}_{it}
\;+\; \boldsymbol{\delta}\mathbf{W}_{it}'\;+\;  \alpha_i \;+\; \lambda_t \;+\; \varepsilon_{it}
}\end{equation}

where \(W_{it}\) is a vector of control variables. We control for
enrollment levels to account for scaling factors in education
expenditure, intergovernmental transfers to account for the significant
role of such transfers in funding education expenditure, percentage of
the population that is Black, percentage of the population that is
Hispanic, and private industry GDP per capita levels to account for
local price levels and economic performance.

\(Y_{it}\) is the natural logarithm of elementary (serving ages 6-12)
education expenditure per pupil for CZ \(i\) in year \(t\). We focus on
elementary education for two reasons. First, this restriction partly
shields against a justifiable concern about the endogeneity between
wages and quality of local public education. Whereas funding for high
school could likely affect local wages given such students are of
working age, funding for elementary education is unlikely to impact wage
rates via a human capital or skills channel. Second, in terms of public
impact, elementary education is of foundational importance in the lives
of children. Slips in public education provision at a young age could
have scarring effects.

\(\alpha_i\) represents a CZ fixed effect and \(\lambda_t\) represents
year-fixed effects, with stage-relevant superscripts.
\(\varepsilon_{it}\) and \(u_{it}\) represents the error term of the
second and first stage, respectively.

We compute the relevant shift-share instrument across 19 two-digit NAICS
industrial categories listed in \autoref{tbl_naics_codes}. Given
industry-level disaggregation of local employment data requires data
suppression for anonymity reasons, Figure 2 displays the data coverage
of our commuting zone level shift-share instruments. Given the high
degree of missingness in the 3-digit categorisation we proceed with the
2-digit NAICS codes in the rest of the work.

In \autoref{tbl_va_ss_baseline}, we demonstrate a strong and highly
significant first-stage relationship wherein our VA-based shift-share
instrument indicates a strong positive contemporaneous relationship with
local wages. We find that a 1\% increase in our shift-share instrument
raises local wages by 0.25\% in the same year though these wages rebound
as evidenced by the statistically significant negative coefficient of a
similar magnitude on the l1 regressor. Essentially, the time dynamics
indicate that local wages respond quickly to national sectoral shocks,
though not permanently. This can likely be interpreted as a temporary
local demand boom following industry-level value added shocks. This
provides additional evidence that the shift-share instrument captures
short-term exogenous variation rather than slow-moving trends in local
wages, boosting credibility in our instrumental variable relevance. The
growth rate specification in columns 3-4 provide further evidence of the
transitory nature of these demand shocks as only the contemporaneous
growth rate effect is significant.

The first-stage F-statistic using the level SS instrument is well above
conventional weak instrument thresholds confirming instrument relevance.
Furthermore, the Wu-Hausman tests reject the null of exogeneity,
confirming that OLS estimates are biased and IV estimation is
appropriate. Wald tests of joint significance further support the
strength of the instruments and the importance of incorporating
time-lagged instruments.

Using wage shocks in levels yields strong instruments, defensible
first-stage F-statistics, and stable second-stage estimates: positive
(negative) local wage shocks robustly decrease (increase) education
spending.

Taken together, these two specifications yield consistent and meaningful
results wherein the shift-share instrument allows for the causal
identification of negative relationship between local wage shocks and
education expenditure. The similarity in magnitude of the two designs
implies that the estimated effect is robust to the timing and
persistence of the underlying economic shocks. Most importantly, this
indicates that the mechanism identified is driven by temporary demand
shocks rather than permanent income effects. Interpretation of these
results requires a further exploration of local heterogeneity, outlined
in the following sections.

One could interpret this result as either a confirmation of resource
course dynamics in communities dependent on industries employing
lower-skill workers. If these effects are concentrated in less
economically prosperous areas, local wage booms in particular sectors
might be distracting public and administrative attention away from local
public education investments. On the other hand, if these effects are
driven by wage booms in communities reliant on higher-skill labour, one
could see this as a potential feedback between decreases in
intergovernmental revenues which are intended to be needs-based, even
though the specification controls for this effect, or potentially a
crowding out of public education by private education. The results below
do not provide a meaningful ability to distinguish the relative accuracy
of either of these hypotheses.

\subsection{Accounting for
Heterogeneity}\label{accounting-for-heterogeneity}

In order to make meaningful policy-related insights, we need to unmask
the substantial heterogeneity obscured by the national-level average
treatment effects described above. These national-level estimates are
unlikely to apply uniformly across states and commuting zones.
Therefore, this next section is dedicated to unpacking this
heterogeneity. Below, we (1) explore various metrics of local economic
growth and decline to partition our sample in a data-driven manner,
employ (2) industry-by-industry and (2) state-by-state estimations in
our IV specifications using our VA-based shift-share instrument.

However, given the high degree of both structural (state-specific tax,
regulatory, and legislative regimes) and evolved heterogeneity
(industrial activity, income, inequality, economic diversity) the
proposed analysis necessitates a disaggregated estimation strategy to
truly account for the heterogeneity across the units of observation.
Therefore, subsequent treatment estimation is dedicated to
state-by-state, industry-by-industry, and a growth cohort sub-sampling
procedure taking into account legacy income and wage growth rates.

For completeness, we provide results of average treatment effects for
all implemented estimations in the Appendices.

\subsubsection{Declining vs.~Growing
Regions}\label{declining-vs.-growing-regions}

First, we identify declining and growing regions by estimating
commuting-zone wage and private industry GDP growth rates conditional on
state and national level growth rates and partition our sample across
this distribution.

In order to identify declining and growing commuting zones, we estimate
separate time series models by commuting zone as follows. These models
allow for the identification of commuting-zone level growth rates while
controlling for state and national trends in a two-step framework.
First, we orthogonalize the state-level growth rate with respect to the
national trend, isolating state-specific fluctuations unrelated to the
national business cycle:

\[
\widetilde{\Delta \log GDPpc}^{state}_{t} 
= \Delta \log GDPpc^{state}_{t} 
- \hat{\gamma}\, \Delta \log GDPpc^{nat}_{t}
\] Second, we regress commuting zone growth on both the national growth
rate and the orthogonalized state residuals, thereby decomposing local
growth into national, state, and idiosyncratic components. This approach
identifies commuting zones whose trajectories systematically diverge
from higher-level aggregate patterns, providing a clean measure of
relative local economic performance.

\[
\Delta \log GDPpc^{CZ}_{t} 
= \alpha_{g} 
+ \beta_{n} \, \Delta \log GDPpc^{nat}_{t} 
+ \beta_{s} \, \widetilde{\Delta \log GDPpc}^{state}_{t} 
+ \varepsilon_{t}
\]

In these equations, each GDP term represents the private industry GDP
per capita at the CZ, state, or national level, denoted by superscript.

\textcolor{red}{I think this can be supported by interesting literature from the "left behind" and "geographies of discontent" literature in which 'relative' economic performance is what matters most for individuals' happiness. Might be a conceptual leap but an interesting connection?}

Intuitively, this specification measures how much of each CZ's growth
can be explained by broader aggregate trends versus localized factors.
By controlling for orthogonalized state and national variation, the
estimated intercept (\(\alpha_{g}\)) and residual terms capture
persistent, region‐specific trends that are not driven by common
macroeconomic forces. This allows us to identify which commuting zones
are systematically growing or declining relative to their state and
national baselines, thereby providing a purer measure of local economic
dynamics that is robust to shared higher-level shocks.

We then classify commuting zones by the value of \(\alpha_{g}\) which
represents their deviation from state- and national-level GDP growth
rates. We estimate this trend deviation in per capita values of private
industry GDP.

\footnote{We provide similar analysis of gross GDP in the Appendix.}

Figure 3 plots the distribution of values of \(\alpha_g\) where the
vertical dashed lines represent the 25th and 75th percentiles.

Next, Figure 4 below demonstrates the considerable variability in
GDP-level growth rates across commuting zones in the US between
2001-2021. Visualising the per capita growth rate deviations by state
and region demonstrates heterogeneity in this variability across states
and regions. For example, Texas, Montana, and Colorado have outstanding
positive outliers in the distribution whereas Kentucky, Louisiana, South
Dakota have outstanding negative outliers.

Finally, Figure 5 represents the distribution of the loadings on the
residualised state factors and the national growth rates at the
commuting zone level.

We perform the same trend deviation calculation for wages where each
wage variable represents the commuting zone, state, and national level
growth rate in the weekly average wage as reported in QCEW.

\[
\widetilde{\Delta \log Wage}^{state}_{t} 
= \Delta \log Wage^{state}_{t} 
- \hat{\gamma}\, \Delta \log Wage^{nat}_{t}
\]

\[
\Delta \log Wage^{CZ}_{t} 
= \alpha_{w} 
+ \beta_{n} \, \Delta \log Wage^{nat}_{t} 
+ \beta_{s} \, \widetilde{\Delta \log Wage}^{state}_{t} 
+ \varepsilon_{t}
\]

In Figure 7, we see that there is similar variability though the
patterns do not consistently indicate the same high- and low-performing
outliers across states indicating that GDP and wage growth are not
consistently correlated across regions. We demonstrate this fact in
Figure 8 where, although there is a positive correlation between
commuting zone GDPpc and wage trend deviations, the decile-decile plot
demonstrates a noisy relationship largely driven by certain outliers.

Figure 11 presents a correlation coefficient by commuting zone between
the two rates, providing greater detail on this relationship.

Below, we display, by state, the Pearson correlation coefficient between
CZ level GDP growth rates and wage growth rates. Interestingly, many
states see nearly exclusively positive correlation coefficients, whereas
others see a mix of commuting zones where the relationship is positive
or negative.

\paragraph{Sample Partitioning by Growth
Rates}\label{sample-partitioning-by-growth-rates}

Using these growth rates, we partition the sample according to the
percentiles described above. \autoref{tbl_gdp_ss_wage_subsamples} and
\autoref{tbl_gdp_ss_gdp_subsamples} examine how the relationship between
local economic conditions and elementary education expenditure per pupil
varies across structurally growing and declining regions as defined in
the previous section. We partition our sample into four sub-samples by
their values of \(\alpha_{w}\) and \(\alpha_{g}\) as shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-categories}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\caption{Category Definitions}\label{tbl-categories}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Category & Definition (\(\alpha_{w}\), \(\alpha_{g}\)) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Category & Definition (\(\alpha_{w}\), \(\alpha_{g}\)) \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Declining & \(\alpha < 0\) \\
Hyper-Declining & \(\alpha < P_{25}\) \\
Growing & \(\alpha > 0\) \\
Hyper-Growing & \(\alpha > P_{75}\) \\
\end{longtable}

Zones with negative (positive) values of \(\alpha_{w}\) or \(\alpha_g\)
are designated as declining (growing), while those in the bottom (P25)
and top (P75) quartiles are labelled hyper-declining and hyper-growing,
respectively. This stratification enables comparison of fiscal
responsiveness across local economies with different long-run growth
trajectories.

\autoref{tbl_gdp_ss_wage_subsamples} partitions CZs by \(\alpha_w\).
Interestingly, we see that the effect of intergovernmental revenue is
nearly half the size in hyper-growing areas than the hyper-declining
areas indicating the importance of intergovernmental transfers in areas
where wages are declining. Additionally, the scaling effects of
enrollment are only significant in regions where wages exhibit high
growth or are moderately declining. Furthermore, the role of private
industry GDP in local elementary education expenditure explains
variation in education expenditure in those regions in which scaling
laws do not seem to apply. Most importantly though, the negative
relationship between annual wages and elementary education expenditure
is only present in areas that exhibit historically hyper-declining or
moderately growing wage trends. Additionally, the first-stage F
statistics only support causal identification in these columns.

In regions where wages are already declining, positive wage shocks
decrease spending on local public education providing potential support
for a story in which regions with declining wages de-prioritise
education when positive wage shocks ``come to town.'' In the case of
moderately growing regions,

\autoref{tbl_gdp_ss_gdp_subsamples} partitions CZs by long-run GDP per
capita trends. When partitioning the sample by GDP growth rates, the
interpretation is more straight-forward. Areas in which GDP is
exhibiting relative decline, the causal relationship between wages and
education expenditure is consistent with high first stage F statistics,
convincing performance on the Wu-Hausman endogeneity test, and
defensible, albeit weak, performance on the Wald test. These results
suggest an asymmetric fiscal response where wage shocks in areas whose
GDP is declining, have a negative effect on local public education
spending, in contrast to growing regions.

\subsubsection{State-by-state
estimation}\label{state-by-state-estimation}

Given the substantial heterogeneity in state-level economic makeup and
public finance regimes, we investigate state-specific and
industry-specific relationships between our variables of interest.

First, states vary in the number of commuting zones they contain. Figure
12 demonstrates that states have anywhere between 2 (Delaware) and 58
(Texas) commuting zones. This allows us to estimate panel-style
regressions within each state to net out between-state variation that
might be confounding our current treatment estimates.

\begin{figure}[H]

Using our instrumental variable approach with a value-added based
shift-share instrument, we corroborate the directionality and magnitude
of the effect for 5 states: Ohio, Missouri, Arizona, Washington,
Delaware, and New Hampshire. Delaware's sample size is so small that
it's likely uninformative. However, the rest of the states provide
interesting points of analysis.

\caption{State-by-State Wage Effect Using SS GDP Shock}

\end{figure}%

Placing the descriptive (linear combination of l0, l1, l2 lagged wage
coefficient values) and causal estimates (second stage regression
estimates - statistically significant second-stage estimates are
represented by solid blue filled circles) side-by-side we can see an
emerging pattern. First, positive wage-education relationships (Ohio,
Arizona, New Hampshire) are corroborated more often than negative ones
(WA). Among the well-identified relationships, only Mississippi and
Missouri's relationship is revealed to be the opposite of what is
suggested by the descriptive regression results.

\subsubsection{Industry by Industry}\label{industry-by-industry}

Second, given our shift-share instruments are the composite effect of
shifts in industry-level wages and real value added, we can decompose
this instrument into industry-specific real value added shocks. This
decomposition allows us to examine the effect of industry-specific
changes across states in a more explicit manner. In other words, our
instrument is\ldots{}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bartik-decomposed}{
    \tilde{Z}_{ijt} = G_{njt} *  \frac{N_{ij\tau}}{N_{i\tau}}
}\end{equation}

\ldots rather than the sum of all industry-level shocks.

We estimate separate panel regressions using the full commuting zone
sample and then grouping commuting zones by state instrumenting local
level wages by these decomposed shift-share shocks by industry.

Using our value added-based shift share instrument, Figure 16
demonstrates the overall treatment effect of local wage changes
instrumented via an industry-specific GDP shock.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

\ldots{}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

The determinants of inequality in public education delivery in the US
are multiple and complex. Significant evidence exists of the role of
historically discriminatory policies related to congressional
districting, under-investment in low-income areas of color. Though this
work does not directly inform this debate, further work could explore
the extent to which wage growth interacts with such structural policies.

\section{Data and Code Availability}\label{data-and-code-availability}
