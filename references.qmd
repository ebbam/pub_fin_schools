@rubin2015 find that wealth is more sensitive to economic growth than labour income. "Wealth derived income is more sensitive to growth than labor income. Labor income of top groups is more sensitive to growth than that of low groups. Positive changes in growth are associated with increases in income inequality." Between 1953-2008. Could justify that growth impacts already higher-wage areas than lower-wage areas. Might imply something about experimental design.

    -   @wilmers2018 - find that increased exposure to buyer power can lead to decreased wages - ie. competition effects.
    -   @deb2022 - find that less competitive market structure lowers wage levels and raises skill premiums.
    -   @yeh2022 - find that manufacturing employers exhibit strong monopsony power where they can markdown wages significantly. this power has only been sharply increasing since the early 2000s. @azar2022 - find a similar result where increased labour market conentration causes a decline in posted wages.
    -   @autor - demonstrate a polarisation of the US labour market
3.  @egger2019 - Find that the higher income earners were taxed more prior to 1994 whereas after 1994, globalisation increased the income tax burden of the middle class while the top 1% of workers faced a reduction in their income tax burden.
4.  @katz1992 **- early exploration of the source of wage inequality between 1963-1987. find that it relates largely to a skills premium and greater labour force participation by women. @kopczuk2010 - similarly find that earnings inequality increased following 1970 with dramatic earnings concentration at the top of the income distribution.**
5.  @lee1999 - an early study in the late 1990s finds that wage inequality was largely attributed to rising dispersion without consideration of the subsequent decline (and rollback) of minimum wage regulations. Find that minimum wage can account for much of the rise in dispersion in the lower tail of the wage distributions.
6.  **Mishel, L., & Bivens, J.** "Identifying the policy levers generating wage suppression and wage inequality." Economic Policy Institute @mishel2021 Though many authors argue that this wage divergence is the result of power and policy that favors capital over labour, rather than "apolitical market forces." @barkai2020 - find that the declining labour share has not been replaced by capital share. rather rents and profit are being extracted instead.
